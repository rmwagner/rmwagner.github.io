<p>Welcome to my tiny personal website! What would you like to see?</p>
<p>Take a look at my <a href="/resume.pdf" target="blank">pdf resume</a> or some of my <a href="/photography.html"> photography</a>.</p>
<p>Lately I've been at <a href="http://roadmunk.com">Roadmunk</a> doing development for their marketing team. We launched a new <a href="https://roadmunk.com/product-to-product-podcast/">podcast</a> and <a href="https://roadmunk.com/roadmapping/">roadmapping learning hub</a> while I was there, if you work in product definitely check them out! I then moved to the product team to help them organize and understand their users and feedback and keep an eye on competitors.</p>
<p>Before that I was in school finishing my degree, but had lots of co-op terms, on one of which I helped build the first version of <a target="blank" href="http://markboard.com">Markboard</a> for <a href="https://www.chalk.com/">Chalk.com</a>.</p>
